Sophisticated Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Requires Philosophy
P1
Sophisticated KR&R must include the representation of not only simple properties, but also concepts that are routine in the formal sciences (theoretical computer science, mathematics, logic, game theory, etc.), and everyday socio-cognitive concepts like mendacity, deception, betrayal, and evil.

The OAR Model of Neural Informatics for Internal Knowledge Representation in the Brain
P4
In contrary to the traditional container metaphor, the human memory mechanism can be described by a relational metaphor. The new metaphor perceives that memory and knowledge are represented by the connections between neurons in the brain, rather than the neurons themselves as information containers.
